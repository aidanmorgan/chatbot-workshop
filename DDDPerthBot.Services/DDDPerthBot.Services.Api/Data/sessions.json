    "title": "Death by Good Intentions",
    "abstract": "After spending time in over 25 different workplaces, I've seen examples of high-performing teams, and those that are totally stifled by their environment.\nI've spent time trying to distill what made each of those places tick and extracted common problems. For each of those problems, I use examples to explain their effect on the team, and the solutions I've seen work to mitigate them. We'll cover topics like security theatre, tech strategy and team setup amongst others. \nBy the end of it you'll come away with a few tools to take back to your organisation to help your teams get stuff done and hopefully make some customers happy along the way."
